## Abstract

An RNA sequence in Aureococcus luminae was identified upstream of the met6 gene in the biosynthesis pathway of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a molecule that is a major methyl group donor in biological reactions. The hypothesis that this RNA sequence is an aptamer which has a binding affinity for SAM was tested using an Inline Probing experiment. The results showed that the RNA sequence does not bind SAM in vitro.
