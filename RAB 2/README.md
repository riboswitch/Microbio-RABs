# RNA sequence in Aureococcus luminae reveals affinity for S-adenosylmethionine in-vivo

## Description

This asset bundle contains information on the in-vivo study of an RNA sequence in Aureococcus luminae that has been identified upstream of the met6 gene in the biosynthesis pathway of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a molecule which is a major methyl group donor in biological reactions. The objective of the study is to verify the hypothesis that this RNA sequence is a riboswitch which has a binding affinity for SAM.

## Contents

- samriboswitch.xls: Raw data from the in-vivo study, including growth curves and luminescence reading curves over time.

## Usage

This asset bundle is intended for users who want to understand the in-vivo study of the RNA sequence in Aureococcus luminae and its affinity for SAM. No additional dependencies or installation instructions are required.

## Accessing the Data

Users can access the data by downloading the samriboswitch.xls file included in the asset bundle. The data can be analyzed using standard spreadsheet software such as Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.

## Applications

This research can be used to further investigate the regulation of riboswitches and their affinity for specific molecules. It can also be used to develop new methods for detecting and studying riboswitches in other organisms.

## How to Use the Data

1. Download the samriboswitch.xls file.
2. Open the file using spreadsheet software such as Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.
3. Review the growth curves and luminescence reading curves to gain an understanding of the data.
4. Analyze the data in more detail using statistical methods and visualizations.

## Abstract

This research asset bundle contains information on the in-vivo study of an RNA sequence in Aureococcus luminae that has been identified upstream of the met6 gene in the biosynthesis pathway of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). The objective of the study is to verify the hypothesis that this RNA sequence is a riboswitch which has a binding affinity for SAM. The study involved transforming constructs containing the X1 promoter and a 5'UTR translational fusion with the bacterial operon luxCDABE into different bacterial strains and performing an assay in 96-well microplates. The raw data from the experiment is available in the samriboswitch.xls file. The results of the study indicate that the RNA sequence is responsive to SAM in the performed in vivo study.
